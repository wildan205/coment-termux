# Requirements
- An active internet connection
- Download and Install F-Droid
- Install Termux from F-Droid
- Install Hacker's Keyboard from Google Playstore.
- Install Nethunter Kex app available on Nethunter Store
- Enough storage space on your device
#  Install F-Droid
- Download and install F-Droid APK from the official F-Droid website.
# Install Termux
- Termux is an open-source application that provides a Linux-like environment on your Android phone. It gives you a terminal interface similar to that you would find on any other Linux distribution allowing you to execute Linux commands or even run a whole Linux distribution on your Android phone. The beauty of it all is that you do not need to root your phone to run this app.

Now, there are two ways in which you can install Termux on your phone.

- Download and Install the app from F-DROiD
- Download the APK file from GitHub
- Tip: Be sure to carefully follow the steps in each method below to avoid any issues when installing Kali Linux on your Android phone later. Following the instructions closely will help prevent errors during the installation process.

- Install Termux from F-DROID
- Now that you already have F-DROID installed, launch the app from the applications menu and tap the search icon to reveal the search bar. Type the word “Termux.”
- F-droid will filter all the applications in its database and list all Termux applications and plugins available. Now select the app with the name “Termux Terminal emulator with packages.” See the image below.
- That will open a new screen where you will see more information about the app and also the “INSTALL” option.
# IMPORTANT NOTE:
- Do not tap the “INSTALL” option to start installing the app. Instead, scroll to the bottom of the app and tap “Versions.” This will reveal all the Termux versions available for installation. As of writing this post, the available versions include 0.118, 0.117, and 0.116.
- Install version 0.117. We tried working with version 0.118 (latest) and we faced so many errors when trying to launch Kali on our Android phone
- After a successful installation, you will see the “UPDATE” option. Do not update the app. Just launch Termux from the applications menu and continue using the installed version 0.117
# Install Termux from GitHub
- Another option you can use to install Termux on your phone is downloading the APK file directly from their official GitHub page. Now, unlike in F-droid where we insisted on installing Termux version 0.117, the only available version on Android is 0.118.

Tip: From our experience, the Termux version 0.118 available on GitHub is different from version 0.118 available on F-droid. That’s because when we installed version 0.118 from F-droid we encountered so many issues and we couldn’t get Kali Linux starting on Android. However, the 0.118 version available on GitHub worked smoothly.

On the Termux Github page, you will see a list of all available releases. Expand the “Assets” section in version 0.118 and download the arm APK file as shown in the image below
